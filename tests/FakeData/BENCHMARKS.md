# GPU correlator benchmark ledger

## Protocol

Metric: **T5 − T1** — wall time of a 5 s FakeData correlation minus wall
time of a 1 s correlation (same config, `tInt = 1 s`, 20 ms subints,
10 stations). Differencing cancels the large constant start-up/shutdown
cost and measures the steady-state correlation rate: the metric is the
cost of 4 s of data.

Run it with `./run-bench.sh [repeats]` (default 3; report best-of-N to
suppress scheduling noise on the oversubscribed desktop). `USEGPU=0`
benchmarks the CPU path; `EXTRA_ENV="DIFX_GPU_PIN_INPUT=0"` etc. for A/B
legs. The script prints a ready-to-paste ledger row.

Rules:
- Machine otherwise idle (no builds, no nsys, no browser).
- Record every change that lands: benchmark at the commit that follows it.
- FakeData output is NOT bit-reproducible run to run (see README) - this
  ledger tracks time only, never correctness.

## Ledger (RTX 2070 desktop, ar313)

| date | commit | mode | T1 (s) | T5 (s) | T5−T1 (s) | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-18 | 785bcaec0 | gpu | 24.0 | 90.7 | 66.7 | first ledger row; Lever A (pinned input) in |
| 2026-07-18 | f39cd5bc3 | gpu | 22.5 | 84.9 | 62.4 | set_weights on device (de-serialization Incr 1) |

## Pre-protocol reference points (15 s of data, tInt 2 s, whole-run wall)

Measured 2026-07-18 during Lever A work; not comparable to the ledger
rows above, kept for the record:

| build | wall (15 s data) |
|---|---|
| pre-Lever-A (1bf496b16+build fixes) | 268.0 s |
| Lever A pinned (785bcaec0) | 258.9 s |
| Lever A, staging fallback (`DIFX_GPU_PIN_INPUT=0`) | 269.3 s |

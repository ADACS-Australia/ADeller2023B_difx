/**
 * @class GPUCore
 * @brief GPU-accelerated subclass of Core for cross-multiplication and averaging.
 *
 * In the legacy CPU implementation, data is heavily partitioned into `xmacstridelen` 
 * chunks to keep working data inside the CPU's L1/L2 caches. The CPU calculates 
 * intermediate cross-multiplies, stores them in `scratchspace->threadcrosscorrs`, 
 * and later un-jumbles them via frequency averaging into `procslots[index].results`.
 * * GPUCore completely bypasses this cache-thrashing architecture. It fuses the XMAC 
 * (cross-multiply accumulate) and frequency averaging steps into a single GPU kernel, 
 * writing contiguous, perfectly formatted visibilities directly to a device-side 
 * results buffer, mirroring the final `procslots` layout natively.
